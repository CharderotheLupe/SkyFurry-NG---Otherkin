## This summary is not a description of each and every mod, but I will highlight on some important ones. For a preview list of mods please check out the list on Load Order Library. https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/skyfurry-ng-otherkin

## There is an MCM setting for Collision Dialogue Overhaul that needs the NSFW comments to be turned off if you require total SFW experience although they are not too raunchy

### Core Mods

SkyFurry NG - Otherkin is built with Simonrim Suite of gameplay overhauls as a core. Almost every part of the game from perks and magic to survival mechanics and combat have been overhauled to bring you a challenging and cohesive experience.

Simonrim can be a bit more challenging than the vanilla game until you "figure things out". I suggest starting out on Apprentice difficulty especially with the added challenge of the accompanying enemy mods.

A bug fix has been added [Clean Save Auto-reloader](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88219) Please note that any loading of saves will restart the game to ensure scripts are loading properly.

## Crusader and Leveling Changes

Crusader is SimonMagus' work-in-progress skill uncapper preset. Though it may seem small, it has some of the most profound effects on the overall feel of the game.



### Overview

 - Crusader is designed to slow the pace of the game significantly, especially at earlier levels, so that players don't breeze past specific areas of the game.
 - This is intended to make the game feel slower-paced.
 - Leveling speed tweaks have been designed with Rested/Well Rested AND Fed/Well-Fed in mind; the player is intended to prioritize these buffs at all times.
 - Leveling speed tweaks have been designed with [Reading is Good](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42026) in mind; the player is intended to acquire skill books to speed mid- to late-game leveling.
 - Crusader is designed to avoid forcing the player to level up "alternate" skills to reach their desired level; the soft cap (level 50) can be reached by leveling only 6 skills.
 - This mitigates some of the other-wise drastic leveling speed changes that the mod makes.

### Leveling Speed

 - Leveling will be much slower throughout the game, but especially in the early game
 - You will no longer rocket past your fist ten levels faster than you can blink
 - The reduction to leveling speed will be lessened as the player levels up (to prevent getting stuck at level 81 for 6 days)
 - The general range is from 80% reduction (at skill level 5) to 50% reduction (at skill level 85)
 - Spells will now receive an XP bonus when dual casting

### Character Level

 - The contribution of skill level to player level is increased for skills above 50
 - Leveling four skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 40
 - Leveling six skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 50
 - Leveling twelve skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 75
 - Leveling eighteen skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 100

## More information from Simon on Crusader.

- Crusader is designed to slow the pace of the game significantly, especially at earlier levels, so that players don't breeze past specific areas of the game.
This is intended to make the game feel slower-paced and "more immersive"; it fits nicely with the Survival Lite mechanics we've been introducing.

Crafting Skills:

Leveling crafting skills will give much less progress towards your character level, for crafting skills below 40
Leveling crafting skills will give much more progress towards your character level, for crafting skills aboe 60
This prevents the player from power leveling early with crafting, and discourages players from interacting with crafting purely for the early levels
This also protects the character from having their character level inflated by leveling a skill that contributes little to nothing to their power at low levels
The total contribution to your character level for reaching 100 with a crafting skill is identical to all other skills

Stats, Perks, and Level Caps:

You will receive 20 Health, Magicka, or Stamina at level 2, based on your choice on level up
You will receive 2 perks for reaching level 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45
You will receive 3 perks for reaching level 50
Level 50 is the "soft cap" for character level. You will no longer receive perks for leveling up, after level 50
The total number of perks you can receive from leveling is 60
You will continue to receive 10 Health, Magicka, or Stamina from levels 51 to 100, based on your choice on level up
Level 100 is the "hard cap" for character level. You will no longer receive stat bonuses for leveling up, after level 100
The total number of stats you can receive from leveling is 500 (at level 50), and 1000 (at level 100)

Carry Weight:

This change is recommended to be paired with a source of early safe storage

### Tips

 There are a couple of things I think are worth keeping in mind when playing this list with Crusader.

 - The slower leveling speeds are meant to incentivize maintaining your needs bonuses from Starfrost and Gourmet.
 - Keep your Rested/Well Rested/Lover's (10%/25%/50%) Comfort bonuses up to increase your experience gain.
 - Fed/Well Fed/Lover's Cooking will grant you 5%/10%/15% extra experience gain.
 - Between these two buff sources you can maintain a max increase of 75% extra experience gain which is quite substantial.
