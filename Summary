##This summary is not a description of each and every mod, but I will highlight on some important ones. For a preview list of mods please check out the list on Load Order Library. https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/skyfurry-ng-otherkin

###Core Mods

SkyFurry NG - Otherkin is built with Simonrim Suite of gameplay overhauls as a core. Almost every part of the game from perks and magic to survival mechanics and combat have been overhauled to bring you a challenging and cohesive experience.

Simonrim can be a bit more challenging than the vanilla game until you "figure things out". I suggest starting out on Apprentice difficulty especially with the added challenge of the accompanying enemy mods.

## Enemy Overhauls include:

## Followers

Although not the main focus on this modlist, I did however include some, mostly highlighting Sa'chil Follower as that is a project I am involved in.



## Crusader and Leveling Changes

Crusader is SimonMagus' work-in-progress skill uncapper preset. Though it may seem small, it has some of the most profound effects on the overall feel of the game.



### Overview

 - Crusader is designed to slow the pace of the game significantly, especially at earlier levels, so that players don't breeze past specific areas of the game.
 - This is intended to make the game feel slower-paced.
 - Leveling speed tweaks have been designed with Rested/Well Rested AND Fed/Well-Fed in mind; the player is intended to prioritize these buffs at all times.
 - Leveling speed tweaks have been designed with Reading is Good in mind; the player is intended to acquire skill books to speed mid- to late-game leveling.
 - Crusader is designed to avoid forcing the player to level up "alternate" skills to reach their desired level; the soft cap (level 50) can be reached by leveling only 6 skills.
 - This mitigates some of the other-wise drastic leveling speed changes that the mod makes.

### Leveling Speed

 - Leveling will be much slower throughout the game, but especially in the early game
 - You will no longer rocket past your fist ten levels faster than you can blink
 - The reduction to leveling speed will be lessened as the player levels up (to prevent getting stuck at level 81 for 6 days)
 - The general range is from 80% reduction (at skill level 5) to 50% reduction (at skill level 85)
 - Spells will now receive an XP bonus when dual casting

### Character Level

 - The contribution of skill level to player level is increased for skills above 50
 - Leveling four skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 40
 - Leveling six skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 50
 - Leveling twelve skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 75
 - Leveling eighteen skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 100

### Crafting Skills

 - Leveling crafting skills will give much less progress towards your character level, for crafting skills below 40
 - Leveling crafting skills will give much more progress towards your character level, for crafting skills aboe 60
 - This prevents the player from power leveling early with crafting, and discourages players from interacting with crafting purely for the early levels
 - This also protects the character from having their character level inflated by leveling a skill that contributes little to nothing to their power at low levels
 - The total contribution to your character level for reaching 100 with a crafting skill is identical to all other skills

### Stats, Perks, and Level Caps

 - You will receive 20 Health, Magicka, or Stamina at level 2, based on your choice on level up
 - You will receive 2 perks for reaching level 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45
 - You will receive 3 perks for reaching level 50
 - Level 50 is the "soft cap" for character level. You will no longer receive perks for leveling up after level 50
 - The total number of perks you can receive from leveling is 60
 - You will continue to receive 10 Health, Magicka, or Stamina from levels 51 to 100, based on your choice on level up
 - Level 100 is the "hard cap" for character level. You will no longer receive stat bonuses for leveling up, after level 100
 - The total number of stats you can receive from leveling is 500 (at level 50), and 1000 (at level 100)

### Carry Weight

 - You will start with 200 Carry Weight
 - You will no longer receive Carry Weight for leveling Stamina
 - There are many sources of Carry Weight in Simonrim; use them
 - With Candlehearth, every inn has safe storage when renting a room.

### Tips

 There are a couple of things I think are worth keeping in mind when playing this list with Crusader.

 - The slower leveling speeds are meant to incentivize maintaining your needs bonuses from Starfrost and Gourmet.
 - Keep your Rested/Well Rested/Lover's (10%/25%/50%) Comfort bonuses up to increase your experience gain.
 - Fed/Well Fed/Lover's Cooking will grant you 5%/10%/15% extra experience gain.
 - Between these two buff sources you can maintain a max increase of 75% extra experience gain which is quite substantial.
